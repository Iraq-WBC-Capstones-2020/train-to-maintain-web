      "body": "Start off by asking yourself why do you really want to workout in the first place.Answering that question is one of the most important things that kept me consistent at what I am doing.The answer to that question is a pill of motivation that boosts me with energy, enthusiasm, and perseverance. Always try to remember why you started to keep yourself on track! We humans always dream of things that might seem to be impossible to accomplish. Remember dreams are only dreams without goals. Don’t dream of accomplishing big things and you are sitting on the couch doing nothing. Show yourself how bad you want it. Having a clear vision of what you want to accomplish is the art of edging toward your dream knowing you are going to do it no matter how hard everything might get. This point could be kind of controversial. Human beings in nature are basically programmed to fear failure. The fear of not being sure that you can make it works out, the fear of what people might think of you when you fail, and also the fear of disappointing the ones who have faith in your success. Personally, I struggled with this point so much till I found out that I was basically improving when I was feeling uncomfortable and I was coming back hungrier, stronger, and more motivated than ever after each failure. Feeling uncomfortable and failing during the process are basic keys to success. Feeling comfortable during my workouts and diet has always been an indication of procrastination and not giving the process everything I got."

      "title": "HOW TO USE A DIET BREAK FOR FAT LOSS TO GET SHREDDED LEAN",
      "overview": "To be successful with a diet, you not only need to know when to make diet adjustments but when to take diet breaks also. A diet break refers to a planned period of 7–14 days, where we increase calorie intake and loosen the counting restrictions we place on ourselves.",

      "body": "They help break up the monotony of a diet and make adherence easier. When you have a lot of fat to lose, it can be very tough to stay motivated for months on end. Similarly, when you’re trying to get shredded lean, the body fights back harder during the last stages of the diet. If a client needs to diet for any longer than three months, I’ll almost always get them to take a diet break of two weeks. If they have a lot of fat to lose, we’ll repeat this more than once. And if a client is trying to get especially lean, I may recommend they take one more frequently (every ~6-8 weeks), depending on how they are feeling. This is not about mental toughness nor commitment. How you feel right now is not an indication of how well you’ll be able to adhere months down the line. Planning for diet breaks is about acknowledging in advance that there are limits to our ability to persevere. It’s the smart thing to do. You’ve probably heard of periodization for your strength training, where you break your training up into phases, each with a specific goal. Think of diet breaks as being part of something you might call nutrition periodization. Most people don’t think of nutrition as something that can be periodized. But logically, you’re not going to diet forever, or you’d waste away. If you’re still relatively new to training, you may be able to hover around maintenance calories for a while and achieve simultaneous muscle gain and fat loss (body recomp). But past a certain point, the changes are so hard to measure, you’ll need to move into a muscle gain phase, known as a bulk. However, as bulking phases always involve a little fat gain, you will need to diet after to bring your fat mass down again."

Oh yeah, and they always served lunch. As the meeting began and lunch was served, hungry grad students swarmed the food table. I observed what appeared to be a lean, healthy and fit female grad student approaching the table. She selected a good sized veggie sandwich and two pieces of fruit. Her friend, who followed behind her in line, appeared to be overweight, unhealthy and un-fit. Her friend moved through the food line and selected a lunch that consisted of diet Coke and a cookie. Who cares, you say? Shouldn’t people be allowed to pick whatever they want for lunch? The dietary displacement gods care and you probably should too. These daily choices can help explain why humans might be getting fatter and more unfit. Have you ever known someone who skips out on a salad with greens, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, beans, sunflower seeds and flax vinaigrette in order to budget their calories for the scone and Frappucino splurge at Starbucks later that evening? Welcome to the land of negative dietary displacement. It’s when someone skips out on healthy eats and displaces them with non-nutritious foods. But even with this displacement, who really cares? I mean, as long as calories are balanced we’ll be just fine, right?"

      "overview": "Fats are organic molecules made up of carbon and hydrogen elements joined together in long chains called hydrocarbons. These molecules can be constructed in different ways, which creates different types of fat and their unique properties. The molecular configuration also determines whether fats will be healthy or unhealthy.",

      "body": "Since humans evolved by consuming a diet of whole foods, fat intake from mono-, poly-, and saturated sources was distributed evenly. Scientists estimate that the omega-6/omega-3 ratio in a hunter-gatherer diet is around 1:1. Humans currently consume a ratio of about 16:1 to even 20:1 – an intake that’s way out of balance. Much of our omega-6 and saturated fat intake is from refined fat sources, not from whole foods. Items like corn oil, safflower oil, and factory-farmed meat/eggs/dairy contain unhealthy balances of fat. Soybean oil alone accounts for over 75% of oils consumed by Americans. People are often concerned about excess dietary fat, but not getting enough “good” fats may also cause health problems. Fat we consume is digested and either used for energy, stored in adipose (fat) tissue, or incorporated into other body tissues and organs. Many of our body tissues are lipid (aka fat) based, including our brains and the fatty sheath that insulates our nervous systems. Our cell membranes are made of phospholipids, which means they’re fat-based too. Thus, the fat we consume literally becomes part of our cells. It can powerfully influence how our cells communicate and interact. For example, fat can affect signaling molecules that influence blood vessel constriction, inflammation, blood clotting, pain, airway constriction, etc. Since our brains are fat-based, changes in fat composition can affect transmission of nervous system impulses. For this reason, balancing our fat intake can promote optimal functioning of our entire body. Therefore it’s important that we emphasize whole food fat sources in our diets, and supplement as necessary."

      "body": " In this article we clear up the confusion. Next time you come down with the flu or a cold, you’ll know what to do. Your friendly neighborhood gym. You’re warmed up and ready for a great workout.Then, all the sudden, Mr. Sneezy walks by. Coughing, sniffling, and heavy mouth-breathing. He’s spraying all over the benches and mats. “Dude, shouldn’t you just stay home and rest?” you’re thinking. (And, while you’re at it, stop sharing those nasty germs?) But maybe Mr. Sneezy’s onto something. Maybe he’ll be able to sweat the sickness out of his system, boosting his immune system along the way. Luckily, our immune system has got a plan. When faced with foreign attack, it works hard to defend us. Without the immune system, we’d never have a healthy day in our lives. Our immune cells originate in our bone marrow and thymus. They interact with invaders through the lymph nodes, the spleen, and mucus membranes. This means they first make contact in your mouth, gut, lungs, and urinary tract."

      "body": "There are some things that novices need to be aware of before they worry about exercise selection and programming, so we’ll cover those first. We’ll then get into specific exercise suggestions, with particular attention to the things we feel that intermediate trainees with differing goals (general body recomposition, physique competition, or strength) should bear in mind. When starting out at the gym you will be tempted to see how heavy you can lift, or try every single exercise and piece of equipment in sight. These are both mistakes. Learning how to perform the exercises properly needs to be your priority. In the next few paragraphs we’re going to detail the technical reasons for this, but basically, the reason you want to follow this advice is because you will limit your long-term strength gains by loading heavy early on with shitty form. Only by becoming a skilled lifter will you truly be able to lift impressive weights, and skilled lifters treat exercises as skills to master. You want to ingrain the movements such that your body will naturally move in certain ways without you actively thinking about it. By learning the exercises first, instead of picking up some random weight and exercises haphazardly, you will develop your ability to keep proper lifting form under heavy load, and this will enable you to train safely and more effectively. When you haven’t learned how to perform the exercises, your ability to reproduce the same movement is limited. This means that when lifting heavy loads, you will more likely place stress in the wrong places, and not only will you miss out on the training effects that you are after, you will also risk injury. If you take up many different exercises right from the start, you will have many different movements to ingrain. This will often slow down the learning process of each exercise. Resist the temptation to do everything. Limit the number of exercises you start with. Focus on learning the correct form. Now, the focus is on learning how to perform the exercises that are important for you to progress as a trainee, not the actual number of exercises per se. Motor learning is complex. There may be scope for adding exercise variations to facilitate the learning process but deciding what additional exercises will help you learn better, often requires the experience of a coach, hence the recommendation to limit the number of exercises chosen to start when you need to make the decisions yourself."
